state of Victoria, Australia, for the product known as the &quot;Persistence of 
Vision Ray Tracer&trade;&quot;, also referred to herein as &quot;POV-Ray&trade;&quot;.
</p>

</p>

<p>
<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
</p>

<p>
This document pertains to the use of the Persistence of Vision Ray Tracer&trade; 
(also known as POV-Ray&trade;). It applies to all POV-Ray program source files, 
executable (binary) files, scene files, documentation files, help files, 
bitmaps and other POV-Ray files contained in official Company archives, 
whether in full or any part thereof, and are herein referred to as the 
&quot;Software&quot;. The Company reserves the right to revise these rules in future 
versions and to make additional rules to address new circumstances at any 
time. Such rules, when made, will be posted in a revised license file, the 
latest version of which is available from the Company website at 
http://www.povray.org/povlegal.html .
</p>

<p>
<strong>USAGE PROVISIONS</strong>
</p>

<p>
Subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, permission is granted 
to the User to use the Software and its associated files to create and render
images. The creator of a scene file retains all rights to any scene files
they create, and any images generated by the Software from them. Subject to
the other terms of this license, the User is permitted to use the Software in
a profit-making enterprise, provided such profit arises primarily from use of
the Software and not from distribution of the Software or a work including
the Software in whole or part.
</p>

<p>
Please refer to http://www.povray.org/povlegal.html for licenses covering
distribution of the Software and works including the Software.
</p>

<p>
The User is also granted the right to use the scene files, fonts, bitmaps,
and include files distributed in the INCLUDE and SCENES\INCDEMO sub-
directories of the Software in their own scenes. Such permission does not
extend to any other files in the SCENES directory or its sub-directories. The
SCENES files are for the User's enjoyment and education but may not be the
basis of any derivative works unless the file in question explicitly grants
permission to do such.
</p>

<p>
This license does not grant any right of re-distribution or use in any manner
other than the above. The Company has separate license documents that apply
to other uses (such as re-distribution via the internet or on CD); please
visit http://www.povray.org/povlegal.html for links to these. In particular
you are advised that the sale, lease, or rental of the Software in any form
without written authority from the Company is explicitly prohibited.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding anything in the the balance of this license agreement,
nothing in this license agreement permits the installation or use of the
Software in conjunction with any product (including software) produced
or distributed by any party who is, or has been, in violation of this
license agreement or of the distribution license (http://www.povray.org/distribution-license.html)
(or any earlier or later versions of those documents) unless:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>the Company has explicitly released that party in writing from
the consequences of their non compliance; or</li>

<li>both of the following are true:</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>the installation or use of the Software is without the User being aware
of the abovementioned violation; and</li>
<li>the installation or use of the Software is not a result (whether direct or indirect) 
of any request or action of the abovementioned party (or any of its 
products), any agent of that party (or any of their products), or 
any person(s) involved in supplying any such product to the User.</li>
</ol>

loss. Damages referred to above shall include direct, indirect, general,
special, incidental, punitive and/or consequential.
</p>

<p>
This disclaimer of liability constitutes an essential and material term of 
this agreement. If you do not or cannot accept this, or if it is
unenforceable in your jurisdiction, then you may not use the Software.
</p>

<p>
<strong>INDEMNITY</strong>
</p>

<p>
You indemnify the Company and Company Associates and hold them harmless 
against any claims which may arise from any loss, damages, harm, injury, 
expense, work stoppage, loss of business information, business interruption, 
computer failure or malfunction, which may be suffered by you or any other 
party whatsoever as a consequence of any act or omission of the Company
and/or Company Associates, whether negligent or not, arising out of your use
and/or distribution of the Software, or from any other cause whatsoever,
howsoever arising, in connection with the Software. These provisions are
binding on your estate, heirs, executors, legal successors, administrators,
parents and/or guardians.
</p>

<p>
This indemnification constitutes an essential and material term of this 
agreement. If you do not or cannot accept this, or if it is unenforceable in 
your jurisdiction, then you may not use the Software.

personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage (&quot;High Risk 
Activities&quot;). The Company specifically disclaims any express or implied 
warranty of fitness for High Risk Activities and explicitly prohibits the use
of the Software for such purposes.

EXPRESSLY MADE CONDITIONAL ON THEIR ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS SET FORTH HEREIN.
</p>

<p>
Except where explicitly stated otherwise herein, if any provision of this 
Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity or 
unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the other provisions of 
this agreement, and all provisions not affected by such invalidity or 
unenforceability shall remain in full force and effect. In such cases you 
agree to attempt to substitute for each invalid or unenforceable provision a 
valid or enforceable provision which achieves to the greatest extent
possible, the objectives and intention of the invalid or unenforceable
provision. The validity and interpretation of this agreement will be governed

<h4>2.5.4.1 Contacting the Authors</h4>
<p>The POV-Team is a collection of volunteer programmers, designers,
animators and artists meeting via the internet at <code>http://www.povray.org/</code>. The
POV-Team's goal is to create freely distributable, high quality rendering
and animation software written in C++ that can be easily ported to many
different computers. If you have any questions about POV-Ray, please visit
our web site for the latest contact information, or see the
<a href="http://www.povray.org/povlegal.html">online version of POVLEGAL</a>
for the current team coordinators address (this changes from time to time
whenever too many email spammers harvest the address).</p>

<p>If you have a question regarding commercial use or distribution of 
POV-Ray, please contact Chris Cason, the development team coordinator,
via the above method. Please do not email us directly for technical support -
use the below-mentioned forums. We generally do not answer emails requesting
support if the sender has not first asked in the forums or read the documentation.
</p>
<p>See our <a href="http://www.povray.org/">web site</a>
and particularly our <a href="http://www.povray.org/groups.html">forums</a> for online peer 
support. The forums have a bug reporting group; please however discuss the issue in the <a href="news://news.povray.org/povray.general">povray.general</a>
group prior to lodging a bug report as we may already know of the issue
(or it might not even be a bug).</p>

<h3>2.5.5 What to do if you don't have POV-Ray</h3>
<p>This documentation assumes you already have POV-Ray installed and running however the POV-Team does distribute this file by itself in various formats including online on the internet. If you do not have POV-Ray or are not sure you have the official version or the latest version, then the following sections will tell you what to get and where to get it.</p>
</div>
<a name="t2_5_5_1"></a>
<div class="content-level-h4" contains="Which Version of POV-Ray should you use?" id="t2_5_5_1">
<h4>2.5.5.1 Which Version of POV-Ray should you use?</h4>
<p>POV-Ray can be used under Windows&trade; XP or newer, x86 Apple&trade; Macintosh&trade;, and Linux&trade; &amp;
UNIX&trade; on numerous hardware platforms. See section <a href="t2_5.html#t2_5_5_2">Where to Find POV-Ray Files</a> for more info.</p>

<p>
Dos, Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, SunOS and Amiga are no longer supported (though we do preserve old versions for these platforms in our <a href="http://www.povray.org/ftp/pub/povray/Old-Versions/">archives</a> if you wish to access them).</p>

<p>
If your platform is not supported and you are proficient in compiling
source code programs written in C/C++, then you may like to retrieve
the source for POV-Ray from our website and attempt to built it
yourself (note that the POV-Team provides no official support for
building POV-Ray from source code).</p>

<div class="content-level-h5" contains="Microsoft Windows" id="t2_5_5_1_1">
<h5>2.5.5.1.1 Microsoft Windows</h5>
<p>
As of POV-Ray version 3.7 the Microsoft&trade; Windows&trade; versions of POV-Ray require Windows XP and later.
We have had reports of v3.7 working on Windows 2000 with all service packs installed, however
we cannot guarantee that this will remain the case indefinitely, as we do not test against W2K.
If you have an older system you may like to look at POV-Ray version 3.6, which works on Windows 95
and up.
</p>

<p>
We supply both 32 and 64-bit versions of POVWIN which have been tested to run with AMD&trade; and
Intel&trade; x86 and x64 processors. As of version 3.7, SMP systems are fully supported; by default
POVWIN will use all available processing cores when rendering. For 32-bit systems, we supply both
non-SSE2 and SSE2-enabled binaries. The installer will determine which is the most appropriate for
your system at install time and install shortcuts to that executable (note however all executables are
always placed in the bin folder regardless of the platform). For 64-bit systems there is only a single
executable - a separate SSE version is not needed as all x64 CPU's have SSE2 available.
</p>

<p>
We recommend 100mb free disk space (the installation does not require that much, but room for
temporary files during rendering is generally required) and at least 1gb free (i.e. available to
POV-Ray at runtime) memory. POV's actual RAM requirement can vary greatly; it's possible to render
files with as little as 30mb of free RAM, but typical needs are much greater than this. The actual
use depends on what SDL files are provided for rendering and the image output options in use. We 
<em>strongly</em> recommend that you have sufficient RAM for rendering your scene files without
resorting to swap - if a render hits the pagefile regularly it will completely destroy rendering
performance.
</p>

<p class="Note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Accelerated graphics hardware (such as 3D cards) will not improve rendering
performance. This technology is not currently aimed at raytracing but is, generally speaking,
optimized for single-precision scanline rendering as used in games or other simulations. POV-Ray,
like all raytracers, requires double-precision floating-point in order to be able to accurately
render scenes.

<h5>2.5.5.1.2 Linux for Intel x86/x64</h5>
<p>
The PC-Linux version should run on any GNU/Linux distribution based on the
kernel 2.2 series or above using the ELF 32-bit format for executables.
The binary is fully static, meaning that it has no external dependencies
to system or third-party libraries.  It includes support for two kinds of
display: the standard text-based display and the graphics display using
either the X Window System or the SVGA library.
</p>

<p>Required hardware and software:
An Intel Pentium-compatible CPU (i586 or better) and at least 32 MB of RAM.
About 20 MB of disk space to install the program, its documentation,
scenes and standard include files.
A text editor capable of editing plain ASCII text files.
Graphic file viewer capable of viewing image formats such as
PNG, TIFF, PPM or TGA.
</p>

<p>Required POV-Ray files:
povlinux-3.7.tgz or povlinux-3.7.tar.gz - archive
containing an official binary combining text, SVGALib and X Window displays.
Also contains sample scenes, standard include files and documentation in HTML
and plain ASCII text.
</p>

<p>Recommended:
Intel Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon XP (faster the better) with
128 MB (text console) / 256 MB (X Window running a window manager) or more RAM.
A recent GNU/Linux distribution with kernel 2.4.x or above running KDE 3.x
for full POV-Ray integration in the window manager.
Alternatively, SVGA display preferably with VESA interface and high color
or true color ability.
</p>

<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> Accelerated graphics hardware will not improve performance.</p>

<p>Optional:
povray-3.7.tgz or povray-3.7.tar.gz - archive containing the generic
UNIX/Linux C++ source code of POV-Ray for UNIX.
The source code is not needed to use POV-Ray.
It is provided for the curious and adventurous.
The archive contains generic Unix parts and Linux specific parts
(namely: support for SVGAlib).
This package does also include sample scenes, standard include files and
documentation.
For displaying purposes, the SVGAlib and X11 (X Window) includes and
libraries can be used by the source code of POV-Ray for UNIX.
See the section related to the
<a href="t2_5.html#t2_5_5_1_4">generic Unix source code package</a> for

<div class="content-level-h5" contains="Apple  Macintosh" id="t2_5_5_1_3">
<h5>2.5.5.1.3 Apple  Macintosh</h5>
<p>The Macintosh version runs under Apple's Mac OS operating system version
8.6 (it may run on 8.1 and 8.5 as well, but we do not support POV-Ray 3.6
running on Mac OS 8.1 and 8.5) or newer with CarbonLib 1.0.4 or newer installed.
Note that we no longer support 68K based Macintosh computers.
POV-Ray 3.7 requires a Power Macintosh!</p>

<p>A Power Macintosh is any iMac, iBook, Mac G3, Mac G4, Mac G5,
Cube, any older Mac with a four digit model number (i.e. 5200,
6300, 7200, 8100, 9600) and any third party computer running Mac
OS 8.1 or later.  Mac OS X 10.2 or later are supported but for
maximum render speed it is not recommended to use Mac OS X.</p>

<p>Required hardware and software: Power Macintosh computer with at least 16
MB of free RAM. Mac OS 8.6 or newer with CarbonLib 1.0.4 or newer installed 
CarbonLib 1.0.4. About 20 MB free disk space to install and an additional 5-10
MB free space for your own creations (scenes and images). Graphic file viewer
utility capable of viewing Mac PICT, GIF and perhaps TGA and PNG formats (the 
shareware GraphicConverter applications is good.)</p>

<p>Required POV-Ray files: POVPMAC.SIT or POVPMAC.HQX - a StuffIt archive
containing the native Power Macintosh application, sample scenes, standard
include files and documentation.</p>

<p>Recommended: Power Macintosh G3 with 64 MB or more of free RAM. Mac OS
9.0.4 or newer with CarbonLib 1.6 (works with Mac OS 8.6 or newer) to access
all features of the Mac frontend. CarbonLib 1.6 is available for free download
from Apple in the software update section of the Apple website. Color monitor
with millions of colors.</p>

<p>Optional: The source code is not needed to use POV-Ray. It is provided for
the curious and adventurous.  POV-Ray can be compiled using Metrowerks
CodeWarrior Pro 7.2 (for other compilers no project or make files are provided).
Read the file &quot;How to compile!&quot; before compiling.  There is no other support or
help for compiling the source code! POVMACS.SIT or POVMACS.HQX - The full C
source code for POV-Ray for Macintosh. Contains generic parts and Macintosh
specific parts. It does not include sample scenes, standard include files and
documentation so you should also get the executable archive as well.</p>

<div class="content-level-h5" contains="Generic Unix" id="t2_5_5_1_4">
<h5>2.5.5.1.4 Generic Unix</h5>
<p>
Because Unix runs on a wide variety of hardware and CPUs, the POV-Team
cannot provide executable versions for every kind of Unix systems.
We distribute a generic, portable C++ source code suitable for running
on Unix or Unix-like platforms.
You will need a recent C++ compiler which follows the ISO C++ standard
as close as possible, and (optionally) the X11 and/or SVGA include files
and libraries (SVGAlib is for GNU/Linux based systems).
Although we provide source code for generic Unix systems, we
do not provide technical support on how to compile the program.
Support may be obtained from the POV-Ray user community on the
dedicated POV-Ray newsgroups (povray.unix at news.povray.org).
</p>

<p>Required hardware and software:
A UNIX operating system with 32 MB of RAM.
A recent C++ compiler, a working make utility and Bourne-compatible shell;
see the INSTALL file in the package for details.
Graphic file viewer capable of viewing e.g. PNG, TIFF, PPM or TGA formats.
A text editor capable of editing plain ASCII text files.
</p>

<p>Required POV-Ray files:
povray-3.7.tgz or povray-3.7.tar.gz - the C++ source code of POV-Ray for UNIX.
Contains generic parts and UNIX/Linux specific parts.  The package includes
sample scenes, standard include files and documentation in HTML and plain
text ASCII format.
</p>

<p>Recommended:
Math co-processor.
128 MB (text console) / 256 MB (X Window running a window manager) or more RAM.
</p>

<p>Optional:
The X Window System (e.g. XFree86) to be able to display the
image while rendering.  The X Window System is available on most UNIX
platforms nowadays.
On GNU/Linux platforms, the SVGAlib library can be an alternative to
the X Window System, as it allows to display the rendered image directly
on the console screen.

<div class="content-level-h5" contains="All Versions" id="t2_5_5_1_5">
<h5>2.5.5.1.5 All Versions</h5>
<p>Each executable archive includes full documentation for POV-Ray itself as well as specific instructions for using POV-Ray with your type of platform. All versions of the program share the same ray-tracing features like shapes,
lighting and textures. In other words, an Windows PC can create the same pictures as a Cray supercomputer as long as it has enough memory. The user will want to get the executable that best matches their computer hardware. In
addition to the files listed above, the POV-Team also distributes the appropriate user documentation. Note this is the same documentation distributed in other archives but in a different format. This may be especially useful for Linux/Unix and Mac OS users because their documentation is in stand-alone HTML only at this time.</p>
